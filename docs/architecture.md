# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub for source control
- CodePipeline for orchestration
- CodeBuild for building containers
- ECS for deployment

### Infrastructure
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Application Load Balancer
- ECS Fargate for container hosting
- Lambda functions for traffic management

### Monitoring
- CloudWatch for logs and metrics
- CloudWatch Alarms for health monitoring
- X-Ray for tracing (optional)

## Workflow

1. Code Push
   - Developer pushes to GitHub
   - CodePipeline triggered

2. Build Phase
   - CodeBuild creates container image
   - Image pushed to ECR

3. Deploy Phase
   - Deploy to Lo-Capacity environment
   - Shift 10% traffic
   - Monitor for issues
   - Manual approval
   - Deploy to Hi-Capacity
   - Shift 100% traffic

## Security

- IAM roles with least privilege
- Security groups for network isolation
- VPC endpoints for AWS services
- Encrypted communication

## Scalability

- Auto-scaling ECS tasks
- ALB for load distribution
- Multi-AZ deployment
